I have not make any fullstack apps yet. One Flask app made in tsoha course
have separate db. So I made separate containers for postgres and the flask
app. There is dockerfile and docker-compose.yml's, but nginx was bit
unnecessary as flask only connects database inside docker network. Anyway
hope this is OK for submissions e21 and e22.

starting point: https://git.hix.fi/kyselma.git/
dockerized version: kyselma/
